  Our system allows peer-to-peer lending scheems to be setup directly between users.

  Interest rates, penulties, and other stipulations can be programmed into the immutable smart-contracts that controll these loans.

  Clients 'trust score' which is their peer-to-peer credit rating is developed, and stored immutably in the blockchain forever linked to the user. This reputation will allow users to secure larger loans even when changing banks.
